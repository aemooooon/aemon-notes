Hello everyone, my name is Hua. I am really happy to have you guys here. Today, I'm going to talk about artificial intelligence-powered recommendation systems, also known as RAs. I will divide my presentation into five parts. This is my overview of what we'll be covering in that session:

- Introduction of RAs
- Applications and benefits of RAs
- Challenges and Concerns of RAs
- Things the Stakeholders could do for RAs
- Conclusion

Now, Let's get started.

RAs are a combination of algorithms used by internet platforms to identify and recommend content, products, and services. Typically, it works by starting with collecting big data, extracting relevant features, and filtering them. Then, it performs model inference to get the results delivered to the end user. 

The RAs have developed for 30 years can be separated into four stages:

The first stage, before 2000, introduced user and item-based collaborative filtering, which focused on the similarities in computation. These foundational techniques marked the beginning of personalised content.

In the 2000s, Latent Semantic Analysis improved text recommendations by matching items and users in a special space. Then, in 2006, Simon Funk's matrix factorisation became a big deal during the Netflix Prize competition. This contest had a $1 million reward and got a lot of people involved. They had to improve Netflix's recommendation algorithm by 10%. Even though the prize stopped in 2009 due to some controversy, it contributed a lot to the community.

From 2010 to 2020, deep learning and big data exploded. In 2015, Google introduced wide and deep learning models. In 2016, YouTube started using deep neural networks for recommendations. We also saw innovations like Pinterest's PinSage for big graph-based recommendations and Alibaba's deep reinforcement learning for dynamic recommendations.

After 2020, RAs really took off with many new systems. OpenAI's GPT-4 is one of the most famous examples, especially GPT-4o.

OK, now let me describe the applications and benefits of RAs:

In terms of End User Experience, it basically includes Customisation, Personalisation and User Engagement. Users can tailor their preferences, and RAs can provide unique content to each individual user. This makes users feel valued and understood, increasing their satisfaction. They are more likely to spend more time on the platform, exploring and interacting with the content. This ongoing engagement is important for user retention and loyalty.

Regardless of platform revenue, it incorporates cross-selling, upselling, targeted marketing and conversion rates. For example, Netflix's recommendation system accounts for about 80% of the content watched on the platform. It demonstrates how important these systems are in driving user engagement and, consequently, revenue.

However, there are still some challenges and concerns. Firstly, Let's start with the "Rabbit Hole" effect. This term describes how RAs can lead users down a path of increasingly narrow content. For example, YouTube's algorithm often suggests videos that become progressively more specific. Like me, I was wondering about learning some DevOps techniques. I started with a Docker container. Then, I found a Kubernetes tutorial and decided to learn Kubernetes. As I kept learning, more related tutorials such as Terraform and Ansible kept popping up, and again and again, the endless suggested videos never stopped catching my attention.

Next, we have the "Echo Chamber." This happens when RAs continuously suggest content that aligns with a user's existing beliefs, reinforcing their opinions without exposure to differing perspectives. This can be particularly tough on social media platforms where users only see posts that match their ideologies. This kind of scenario is extremely dangerous for extremists.

Lastly, the "Filter Bubble." This concept is about users getting stuck seeing the same kind of information over and over. The algorithm only displays things they wanted before. This means they don't always catch new or different ideas that could change their consideration.

Other issues such as data privacy, security, algorithm fairness, and transparency. I am not talking about these issues today because I found so many classmates have already spoken about them. The reality is that regulations always lag behind algorithm development and implementation.

So we should think about what kind of solutions we could deal with.

First, platforms should add diversity metrics and user control to their algorithms. For example, YouTube used some metrics to make sure different content creators are included, leading to a more balanced content combination. Also, giving more user control to improve user interfaces and experiences is very important. Platforms like Netflix and Spotify have easy-to-use interfaces that let users adjust their preferences, which helps with transparency and user authorisation.

Next, policymakers. Governments need to regulate and oversee RAs to make sure they are fair, transparent, and accountable. The European Union's GDPR requires transparency in how algorithms make decisions, giving users the right to know how their data is used. 

Lastly, individuals can improve their digital literacy, which means learning how to navigate online content and understand AI systems. Countries like Finland have media literacy programs in schools to help people become more critical of online information. Moreover, using privacy-focused tools such as the DuckDuckGo browser can also help address privacy settings and protect user data.

Finally, students, especially data science students, have a significant responsibility as future developers. We should aim to create fair and unbiased algorithms, develop transparent and trustworthy models, and promote the use of high-quality, reliable data for better recommendations. Suppose we keep focusing on these kinds of areas so that we will have a better digital environment.
