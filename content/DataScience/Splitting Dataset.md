## Split Train and Test Dataset

### What is Splitting Train and Test Dataset?

Splitting a dataset into training and test sets is a fundamental technique in machine learning used to evaluate the performance and generalization ability of a model. 

- **Training Set**: The portion of the dataset used to train the model. It helps the model learn the underlying patterns in the data.
- **Test Set**: The portion of the dataset used to evaluate the model's performance. It helps assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

### Why Do We Split the Dataset?

1. **Evaluate Model Performance**: To objectively assess how well the model will perform on new, unseen data.
2. **Prevent Overfitting**: To ensure the model is not just memorizing the training data but learning the underlying patterns.
3. **Model Validation**: To fine-tune hyperparameters and select the best model through techniques like cross-validation.

### How to Split the Dataset?

#### Basic Split

The simplest way to split the dataset is to divide it into two parts: a training set and a test set. This can be done using various libraries such as scikit-learn.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Example dataset
X = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]]
y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

print("Training set:", X_train, y_train)
print("Test set:", X_test, y_test)
```

#### Cross-Validation

For a more robust evaluation, cross-validation can be used. This involves splitting the data into multiple training and test sets to ensure the model's performance is consistent.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Example dataset
X = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]]
y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Create a model
model = LinearRegression()

# Perform 5-fold cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)

print("Cross-validation scores:", scores)
print("Average cross-validation score:", scores.mean())
```

### Industry Best Practices

1. **Random State**: Always set a random state to ensure reproducibility.
   ```python
   train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

2. **Stratified Split**: When dealing with imbalanced datasets, use stratified splitting to ensure the training and test sets have a similar distribution of classes.
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
   skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5)
   ```

3. **Data Leakage**: Ensure that the test set is not used during the training process to avoid data leakage, which can lead to overly optimistic performance estimates.

4. **Scaling Data**: Apply scaling to both training and test sets but fit the scaler only on the training data to prevent data leakage.
   ```python
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

   # Fit the scaler on the training data
   scaler = StandardScaler().fit(X_train)
   
   # Transform the training and test data
   X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
   X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
   ```

5. **Large Datasets**: For very large datasets, a simple train-test split might suffice, but ensure the test set is representative of the overall data.

6. **Time Series Data**: For time series data, use techniques like time-based splitting to maintain the temporal order of the data.
   ```python
   train_size = int(len(data) * 0.8)
   train, test = data[:train_size], data[train_size:]
   ```

### Example: Train/Test Split and Model Evaluation

Here is a complete example demonstrating how to split a dataset, train a model, and evaluate its performance using MSE:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Generate example data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'height': np.random.randint(150, 200, 100),
    'rescues_last_year': np.random.randint(50, 70, 100)
})

# Split the data
X = data[['height']]
y = data['rescues_last_year']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on training and test set
y_train_pred = model.predict(X_train)
y_test_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse_train = mean_squared_error(y_train, y_train_pred)
mse_test = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_test_pred)

print("MSE on training set:", mse_train)
print("MSE on test set:", mse_test)
```

### Nuances of Test Sets

#### Test Sets Can Be Misleading

Although test sets are helpful to identify overtraining, they can provide us with false confidence. Specifically, test sets are only useful if they reflect data that we expect to see in the real world. For example, if our test set is very small, it won't be representative of the variety of data that we're likely to see in the real world. Test datasets are also only as good as their source. If our test dataset comes from a biased source, our metrics won't reflect how things will behave in the real world.

For example, if we're trying to find the relationship between the number of rescues and the age a dog started training, a small or biased test set might not accurately represent the real-world scenario.

#### Test Sets Aren't Free

We've already seen that the more training data we have, the less likely our model will overfit. Similarly, the larger the test sets, the more we feel we can trust our test results. However, we usually work with finite amounts of data, and a datapoint can't be in both the training and the test set. This means that as we get larger test sets, we get smaller training datasets and vice versa. Exactly how much data should be sacrificed to appear in the test dataset depends on individual circumstances, with anything between 10-50% being relatively common, depending on the volume of data available.

#### Train and Test Isn't the Only Approach

It's worth keeping in mind that train-and-test is common, but not the only widely used approach. Two of the more common alternatives are the hold-out approach and statistical approach methods.

- **The Hold-Out Approach**: Like train-and-test, but instead of splitting a dataset into two, it's split into three: training, test (also known as validation), and hold-out. The training and test datasets are as we've described previously. The hold-out dataset is a kind of test set that's used only once when we're ready to deploy our model for real-world use.
    
- **Statistical Approaches**: Simpler models that have originated in statistics often don't need test datasets. Instead, we can calculate what degree the model is overfit directly as statistical significance: a p-value.
#### Example
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Generate example data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'height': np.random.randint(150, 200, 100),
    'rescues_last_year': np.random.randint(50, 70, 100)
})

# Split the data
X = data[['height']]
y = data['rescues_last_year']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on training and test set
y_train_pred = model.predict(X_train)
y_test_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse_train = mean_squared_error(y_train, y_train_pred)
mse_test = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_test_pred)

print("MSE on training set:", mse_train)
print("MSE on test set:", mse_test)
