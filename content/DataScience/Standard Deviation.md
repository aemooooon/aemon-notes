>[!Standard deviation]
>is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of data values. It represents how spread out the values in a dataset are from the mean (average) of the dataset. 

# Interpretation

1. **Small Standard Deviation**:
   - Indicates that the data points are close to the mean.
   - Implies less variability and more consistency within the dataset.
   - Example: In a class where most students score similarly on a test, the standard deviation of the scores will be small.

2. **Large Standard Deviation**:
   - Indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.
   - Implies greater variability and less consistency within the dataset.
   - Example: In a class where students' test scores vary significantly, the standard deviation will be large.

# Formulas

## Population Standard Deviation

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}}
$$

Where:
- $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.
- $x_i$ represents each data point in the population.
- $\mu$ is the population mean.
- $N$ is the number of data points in the population.

## Sample Standard Deviation

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}
$$

Where:
- $s$ is the sample standard deviation.
- $x_i$ represents each data point in the sample.
- $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean.
- $n$ is the number of data points in the sample.

# Applications

1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Used to measure the volatility or variability of data.
   - A smaller standard deviation indicates that data points are close to the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates that data points are spread out.

2. **Quality Control**:
   - Used to monitor the consistency of product quality.
   - A smaller standard deviation indicates consistent product quality, while a larger standard deviation indicates more variation in quality.

3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - In finance, used to measure the volatility of investment returns.
   - A higher standard deviation indicates higher risk due to greater variability in returns, while a lower standard deviation indicates lower risk and more stable returns.

# Example Calculations

## Population Standard Deviation Example

Consider a population with data points: 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9.

1. Calculate the mean ($\mu$):
   $$
   \mu = \frac{2+4+4+4+5+5+7+9}{8} = 5
   $$

2. Calculate each deviation from the mean, square it, and sum:
   $$
   \sum (x_i - \mu)^2 = (2-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + (5-5)^2 + (5-5)^2 + (7-5)^2 + (9-5)^2 = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 16 = 27
   $$

3. Divide by the number of data points ($N$) and take the square root:
   $$
   \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{27}{8}} = \sqrt{3.375} \approx 1.84
   $$

## Sample Standard Deviation Example

Consider a sample with data points: 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9.

1. Calculate the mean ($\bar{x}$):
   $$
   \bar{x} = \frac{2+4+4+4+5+5+7+9}{8} = 5
   $$

2. Calculate each deviation from the mean, square it, and sum:
   $$
   \sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 = (2-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + (5-5)^2 + (5-5)^2 + (7-5)^2 + (9-5)^2 = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 16 = 27
   $$

3. Divide by the number of data points minus one ($n-1$) and take the square root:
   $$
   s = \sqrt{\frac{27}{7}} \approx 1.96
   $$
