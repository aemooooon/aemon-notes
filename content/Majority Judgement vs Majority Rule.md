Hi everyone, my name is Hua.

Before we get started, let's take a moment to think about some of the voting experiences we've had. I remember when I was in primary school, our teachers would have us vote for a class or course representative. As we grew up, voting became even more important. Every time there's a national election, we get to choose our country's leaders. And even now, as students, we still cast votes at the end of each semester to evaluate the courses we've taken.

In general, voting is a big part of our lives, playing a significant role in decision-making. But here's the thing—do we really understand how the voting rules affect the outcomes? To be honest, I had no idea before taking this course. The terminologies such as domination paradox, different kinds of consistency, and strategic manipulation were absolutely new to me.



Today, I'm gonna to talk about Majority Judgment versus Majority Rule.

I'm gonna divide my presentation into four parts:

- Majority Rule
- Majority Judgment
- Handling Polarization in Voting
- Resisting Strategic Manipulation



Okay, now let's start with Majority Rule. The metrics is that whoever gets the most votes wins. It's straightforward especially when there are only two options. Whether we're choosing between two leaders, two policies, or even two ice cream, Majority Rule feels like the natural choice. But sometimes, it doesn't seem fair. One issue is called Condorcet consistency. The idea is that if a candidate beats every other candidate in a head-to-head comparison, they should be the overall winner. Majority Rule aims to do this, but it often fails, especially when there are more than two candidates.

For example, as you can see here, we have three candidates: X, Y, and Z, as the voting distribution shows here. X beats Y, Y beats Z, and Z beats X, forming a Condorcet cycle. So, there's no clear winner because each candidate is preferred over another. Even though X has the most first-choice votes, the majority prefers Z over X in direct comparisons. This display the Condorcet Consistency Problem, where simple majority voting doesn't truly capture what voters want. It highlights some weaknesses in the Majority Rule.



Another concept tied to Majority Rule is the domination paradox. Let me give you a quick example to explain this. Look at this table: Candidate A clearly outperforms Candidate B overall, with more 5-star, more 3 stars or higher, and fewer 1-star evaluations. But suppose we only count the assessments above 3 stars, using a simple majority rule. In that case, Candidate B wins by a small margin which is one. This is the Domination Paradox, It is shows that how a basic voting rule can lead to a result that doesn't match the overall preference. It can create some unreasonable results.



Okay, let's introduce the concept of Majority Judgment using the example of restaurant voting at the our campus. We have three restaurants: The Foundry, Ancestral, and Café 1894, which were voted based on three criteria: food quality, service, and atmosphere. The voting are on a scale from 1 to 5 stars, where 1-2 stars are considered "Poor," 3-4 stars are "Average," and 4-5 stars are "Excellent." In Majority Judgment, instead of just picking a favourite restaurant, each restaurant is evaluated across these sort of criteria, and everyone gives each restaurant a star.

In this case, we need to focus on three key components: First, the Merit Profile. The Merit Profile is that how much ticks each restaurant received. In the diagram, we can see three type of assessments—Poor (red), Average (yellow), and Excellent (blue). The height of each bar represents the number of votes or assessments the restaurant received in each category. This gives us an overview of how the restaurant performed across different evaluation levels.

Second, the Majority Grade: The Majority Grade is the middle point or median value, where half of the voters voted it higher, and half voted it lower. In this chart, we use this dashed line to represent the Majority Grade. Essentially, this grade indicates the central tendency of the evaluations, gives us a good idea of how the restaurant performed overall.

Third, the Majority Gauge: The Majority Gauge provides additional detail beyond just the median value. It indicates how the votes are distributed around that Majority Grade. The Majority Gauge would give us a clearer picture by telling us something like, "30% of the assessments are above Excellent, and 20% are below Poor," for example. This helps to understand not just where the median value lies but also how strongly people feel about the restaurant.



Now let's take a look at how voting methods perform in situations of polarization. So, what is polarization? In the context of voting, polarization occurs when voters are deeply divided, often into two opposing groups with strong and conflicting preferences. This is something we usually see in political elections. For example, let's consider the 2012 French presidential election. In this election, voters were polarized mainly between two leading candidates—Hollande and Sarkozy. Each had a solid base of supporters who strongly favoured them over the other. This kind of division creates a challenging environment for any voting method.

How do Majority Judgment and Majority Rule work in polarized situations?

In a highly divided setting, Majority Rule might seem okay because it shows which side has more supporters. But it doesn't always capture how strongly people feel, especially when some voters really dislike a candidate. This is where Majority Judgment does better. Instead of just tick a yes or no option, it uses ratings, which can handle the complexities of a divided electorate. So, Majority Judgment not only works well in polarized settings but also gives a more transparent, and detailed. It's a more flexible and reliable way to capture what voters really want, no matter how aligned or divided they are.



Let’s move onto about one of the biggest challenges in any voting system: strategic voting. So, what is strategic voting? It’s when voters don’t just pick their favorite option; instead, they try to game the system to get a better result for themselves. For example, a voter might rank a less preferred candidate higher just to block a candidate they dislike even more. This kind of manipulation can mess up the results and lead to outcomes that don’t really reflect what voters honestly want. This issue is so important that there’s even a famous theorem about it—the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Impossibility Theorem. It says that in any voting system with three or more options, you can’t design a system that’s both fair and completely free from strategic voting. In other words, no matter how you set up the rules, there will always be situations where voters have a reason to vote strategically rather than honestly.

So, why does Majority Judgment work better?

First, **Honesty is Rewarded**: Voters give a score for each candidate, which encourages them to be honest. If someone tries to game the system by inflating or deflating scores, it’s likely to backfire, especially if most voters are being honest.

Second, **Polarization and Strategy**: In highly divided situations, Majority Judgment has been shown to resist manipulation. Even if some voters try to skew the results, the outcome still reflects the true middle ground of voter opinion.

Third, **Partial Strategy-Proofness**: Even though no system can be completely immune to strategic voting, Majority Judgment comes close by being partially strategy-proof. This means that in most cases, voters don’t gain much by voting dishonestly, making it a more reliable system.

Overall, strategic manipulation is a challenge for every voting system, Majority Judgment offers a big improvement over traditional methods. It encourages voters to be honest, reduces the impact of strategic voting, and produces results that better reflect what voters really want.




Majority Judgment is being used in various real-world scenarios, such as political elections, academic evaluations, and companies.




Okay, in summary, we've talked about the limitations of Majority Rule and introduced Majority Judgment as a better voting method that provides a fuller picture of voter preferences and reduces the impact of strategic manipulation.




Thank you for listening. Don't be hesitate to ask if you have any questions.
